 <h1>  Our Story </h1>
 <p>
 <img src="laceyalex3.jpg" alt="Lacey and Alex"><br> 
<br>  We're sure you've heard this one before ... but our wedding calls for a fresh reminder! 
On September 18, 2019, we first laid our eyes on each other, at the studio of a mutual friend who was hosting a sci-fi–themed LARP. 
     Lacey ended up playing a healer, Alex a relationship expert… and the rest is history.<br> 
     <br> 
Locked down together during COVID, secretly, in a women-only collective housing, our love only grew stronger.
And on July 18, 2023, Alex proposed, spontaneously while they were lounging in bed 
(although a lucky ruby ring had been burning a hole in his pocket for months, 
ever since he knew it belonged to Lacey).<br> 
     <br> 
A year into what would become our three-year engagement, we went on a mountain hiking trip with Lacey’s brother, Cooper. 
Our stay at the Hotel Regina in Mürren finally answered our year-long search for the perfect place to bring our families together.
<br> 
Now, seven years into our love story, we are finally tying the knot, and we cannot wait to celebrate with ourloved ones.<br> 
     <br>
